# Python Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project written in Python as part of my learning journey.  
It includes multiple versions to demonstrate progress and improvements over time.

## Versions

- **calculator_v0_1.py**  
  Basic calculator using simple input/output, without functions. Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operations with basic input validation.

- **calculator_v0_2.py**  
  Improved version with:
  - Separate functions for each operation
  - Error handling using `try/except`
  - Division-by-zero protection
  - Continuous usage in a while loop

## Future plans (v0.3)

- Ask the user if they want to calculate again or exit
- Prevent "None" from being printed after division by zero
- Improve messages for invalid operations

This project helps me practice Python basics like input, conditions, loops, functions, and error handling.  
Later I plan to expand it with a graphical interface using `tkinter`.
